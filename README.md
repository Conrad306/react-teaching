# React Teaching 
In this repository, my main goal is to teach you fundamental information about Reactjs. I don't expect you to know much about it to begin with, but I do need to you to understand that you will not come out of this an expert react programmer. This course will teach you:
- The Basics of React
- Routing
- Dynamic Pages
- Conditional Rendering
- Hooks (the widely used ones)
- Using Typescript
- Creating your own Hooks and Components, and using them.
- and more.
Check the readme.md in each directory to understand what is covered in each file.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of core Javascript / Typescript
- Familiarity with Nodejs 
- Familiarity with HTML and CSS
